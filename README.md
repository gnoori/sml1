Problems–Write a functionmakeLstof typeint -> int listthat takes as input a positive integernandreturns the list[1, 2, ..., n]. Your function does not need to work with non-positive integer.–Write a functionremoveMultof typeint list * int -> int listthat removes all multiplesof a given integer from a list.–Write a functionprimesof typeint -> int listthat outputs a list of all prime numbers whichare smaller than or equal to a given integern >2. You should use the sieve of Eratosthenes1andpreviously defined functions to calculate these numbers.Do not use any pre-implemented functions of the formList.xyz(...).
